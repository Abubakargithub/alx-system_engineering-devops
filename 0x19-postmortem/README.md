Issue Summary:

On May 10th, 2023, between 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM PST, the login service for our online shopping platform experienced an outage. The outage impacted all users attempting to log in, resulting in a 100% service downtime during that time period.

Timeline:

1:00 PM PST - The issue was detected when the monitoring system alerted the DevOps team of increased error rates in the login service.

1:05 PM PST - The DevOps team initiated a triage process to identify the root cause of the issue. Initial investigations suggested that the issue was due to an increase in traffic from a recent marketing campaign.

1:15 PM PST - The team attempted to scale up the login service's capacity to handle the increased traffic. However, the issue persisted, and the login service remained inaccessible.

1:30 PM PST - Further investigation revealed that the issue was due to a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing it to route traffic to a non-existent server.

2:00 PM PST - The issue was escalated to the engineering team, who promptly investigated the misconfiguration.

2:30 PM PST - The engineering team identified the root cause of the issue and corrected the misconfiguration.

3:00 PM PST - The login service was fully restored and functioning as expected.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing it to route traffic to a non-existent server. This misconfiguration was likely introduced during a recent deployment. The engineering team corrected the misconfiguration by updating the load balancer's configuration.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar outages from happening in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

Implement a deployment checklist that includes load balancer configuration checks.

Improve the monitoring system to detect misconfigurations in the load balancer.

Conduct a comprehensive review of the load balancer configuration and implement best practices.

Update the load balancer configuration documentation and provide training to relevant team members.

Schedule regular load balancer configuration audits to identify potential misconfigurations.

To address the specific issue, the following tasks will be completed:

Review the recent deployment to identify the introduction of the misconfiguration.

Conduct load testing to ensure the updated configuration can handle anticipated traffic.

Update the monitoring system to provide better visibility into the load balancer's behavior.

Conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement in the incident response process.

By implementing these measures and completing these tasks, we aim to improve the reliability of our services and minimize the impact of any future incidents.
